To build the application, you need at least the Qt 4.5 libraries and header 
files. You can obtain these from the Qt website (http://qt.nokia.com) or, if 
you are using Linux, also from your distribution-specific packaging system.
In either case, type the following commands to build the application:

  qmake && make release

or, if you are building on Windows:

  qmake && nmake release

After the build has finished, start the application:

  ./GeoJackal

or, if you were building on Windows:
  
  release\GeoJackal.exe
